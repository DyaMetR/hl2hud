## Do not open an issue to ask for help!

If you need help about how to use the HUD head to the [Steam Workshop page discussions]() and leave a post there! Look within already existing posts to see if someone else had your question answered to save time.

## Reporting an issue

If you encounter a bug you have two options:

+   Post a message in the addon's Workshop page [bug report thread](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2954934766/6142387507319055361).
+   [Open an issue](https://github.com/DyaMetR/hl2hud/issues) on the repository.

### How to report an issue

1. Describe the problem.
2. Provide a brief set of instructions to replicate said problem.
3. Post any errors that may popup.
4. In case of the problem being related to an addon post either a **download link** or **link its GitHub repository**.
   1. The download link **must** come from a reputable website (preferably the **Steam Workshop** or [garrysmods.org](garrysmods.org)).
   2. If you can't provide a download link because the problem is being caused by a **private addon** contact its author instead.

Community feedback and contributions are welcome as long as they stay relevant within the repository scope. You can [open a pull request](https://github.com/DyaMetR/hl2hud/pulls) and propose improvements to the code base.

## Relevant contributions

+   Bug fixes.
+   Quality of life improvements.
+   Optimization.
+   Improving code maintainability.
+   Fixing typos on _UI related labels_ (not code).

Preferably, keep pull requests centered around a topic, centering on one change (and kind of change) at a time. **And make sure it properly works before submitting** -- _because no one else will make it work for you_.

## Why your pull request might be rejected

+   It is not properly described.
+   It doesn't work properly or causes errors.
+   Contains backdoors and other malicious code.
+   Unjustified or unrelated mixing of types of contributions (see previous section).
+   Code is too difficult to maintain.
+   Code is too difficult to read (including lack of comments, proper variable names, ...).
+   Code does not follow the style of the rest of the project.
+   Irrelevant code changes such as only editing comments or variable names.
+   Adds content that probably belongs into a separate addon.
